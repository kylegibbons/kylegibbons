## Experience

### Security
Over 10 years experience designing, installing, and configuring security systems
of all shapes and sizes. From small systems consisting of only a few doors or
cameras to large systems spanning multiple states with hundred to thousands of
doors and cameras. Work on security in many different verticals: oil and gas, retail,
event spaces (theatres and stadiums), education, and many more. Installed and
trained on many different software and hardware vendors.

### System Administration
Worked for two employers as the System Administrator / Network Engineer. Both
systems were 24/7 life safety systems where uptime was a priority. Transitioned
from physical to virtual servers. Dramatically improved reliability and serviceability
of infrastructure. Worked with stakeholders from across the businesses to ensure
that the IT systems met their needs.
## Notable Projects

### Mercedes Benz Stadium (Home of the Atlanta Falcons)

Was brought in at the
eleventh hour to ensure the success of the project. The project included over 600
IP cameras and 600 IP door controllers across a 2 million square foot sports and
entertainment facility. Coordinated with multiple vendors to ensure devices were
installed and configured correctly. Provided guidance on proper installation and
configuration of software end endpoints. Worked with end user to ensure system
was configured to best suit their operational requirements. Developed testing
and audit procedures used by the architect to validate the correct installation of
IP cameras and door controllers. Worked with customer IT, IBM, and Zhone to
ensure proper configuration of the Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) as
well as workstations for use in an IP surveillance system. Developed numerous
scripts as well as a web application to display near real-time information about
the status of the installation which was used by both office staff and field
technicians. Supported stadium operations for inaugural training exercises and live
events.

### American Alarm and Communications, Inc.

Designed and implemented new
network to replace aging fault-prone infrastructure. Prior to redesign, network
outages were a common occurrence and late-night pages were a weekly event.
Post-implementation they are a rare occurrence. Replaced WAN infrastructure
at 5 locations with MPLS and internet backups. Moved from a design involving
many physical networks to one with many VLANs. Separated traffic onto distinct
subnets to improve security. Implemented new edge routers and added redundant
switching in the core and at the edge of the network. The headquarters location
where most of the work took place is a 24/7 life safety call center which had to
remain functional during the transition.

### Blackstone Police Department

Coordinated the planned evacuation of the
communications center do to fumigation of spider infestation. Arranged for
Worcester County Sheriff’s Office mobile command unit to be on site. Moved all
KYLE GIBBONS
dispatch functions including: phone, CCTV, CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch), box alarm, and radio to mobile command center. Established radio channel to communicate with backup PSAP with the assistance of the State Police Communications Section. Coordinated fail-over of 9-1-1 to backup PSAP.
